          <h2>The heart in Every Stitch</h2>

          <p>
            I believe each piece of embroidery tells a story. It's a slow,
            meditative art form that stands against the rush of modern world.
            Every thread is chosen with care, every stitch made with care and
            focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to create more than just decor; it's to create future
            heirlooms. That's why I insist on using the highest quality
            materials, ensuring the colours stay vibrant and the fabric remains
            timeless for years to come.
